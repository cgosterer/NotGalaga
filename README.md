Our project aims to create a basic desktop game that was originally intended to be some what of a clone to the 1980's arcade game named Galaga. The only libraries
that were used for our project were pygame 1.9.3 sys, os, time, and random. The user starts the game and is greeted with the main menu screen, they then use the 
arrow keys to select the option they want. Once the player actually enters the game the common methods for player control are used. Arrow keys to move our pilot
and space bar to fire the pilots weapon. The user can press 'u' for the upgrades menu and then press they key in the parentheses to actually upgrade that part
of their ship. There are on screen directions to get back to the game from the upgrade screen. The user can also press the 'p' key to bring up the pause menu, the
pause menu is then navigated through with the arrow keys and the enter button. When strictly comparing our game to Galaga, our game has extra features including, 
the mentioned upgrades menu, a currency system, a pause menu, and a main menu. Along with one final super massive boss. The separation of work is as follows, Chris 
Osterer was responsible for building the pilot class and all actions associated with it, firing, moving, and upgrading. Chris also designed the basic 5 levels of
Enemies that we see as the player progresses through the game. Chris also worked on setting up the initial game window, and designing the upgrade screen. Chris
also set up the collisions between enemy and pilot, and also the collisions between the missle and the enemy ships. We originally had the idea to have the enemies
fly in special patters around the screen but ended up making them move in a more linear fashion towards the pilot. Chris also designed the game over screen. We somewhat
implemented this with the boss enemy that appears at the end of the game as it does implement a special set of moves. Christian was responsible for designing the
main menu, and its functionality. Christian also designed the the big bad boss enemy that appears at the end of the game including its special movements and dives. 
He also designed the collisions	for the boss ship. Christian also worked on the design of the pause menu and its events. Christian also designed the settings page
that enables saves and loads. Adam was responsible for creating some of of the images along with implementing the saved/load game functionality and also
designing the  settings page.
